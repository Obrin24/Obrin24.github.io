          <h3>Passion</h3>
          <p>I'm enthusiastic about leveraging AI to solve real-world problems and am actively seeking opportunities to contribute to innovative projects in the field. My focus has been on growing my knowledge in the Data Science applications with disciplines in Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I have grown to have a passion for these types of models and computing/analyzing the information recieved from the models. I wish to get more experience with these types of models and apply them into the Medical Field with diagnoising patients or analyzing images to reach conclusions about patient status. Also the usage of monitoring different systems in any field, and making sure performance is going well and adjusting the pre-existing models where a better outcome can be achieved.</p>
